# ReferrAI

**ReferrAI** is an open-source community stewarding **neutral infrastructure for AI referral and intent provenance**.

We focus on building *boring, privacy-safe, standards-first* specifications that help the ecosystem understand **where AI-generated intent comes from** — without tracking users or introducing identity systems.

---

## What We Do

ReferrAI maintains open specifications and reference materials for:

- **AI intent provenance** (not attribution, not tracking)
- **Referral transparency** between AI systems, publishers, and retailers
- **Privacy-first primitives** that operate without user identity

Our work is designed to be:
- 🚫 No PII
- ⏱ Short-lived by default
- 🔍 Verifiable, not persistent
- 🔌 Optional and interoperable

---

## Projects

### 🧩 AI Intent Provenance Protocol (AIPP)
A lightweight, cryptographically verifiable protocol for documenting **where AI-driven commerce intent originated**.

- No user identity
- No payments or settlement logic
- Complements AdCP, RMNs, and provenance standards

👉 See the `ai-intent-provenance-protocol` repository.

---

## What We Are Not

To be explicit, ReferrAI is **not**:

- A company or commercial product
- An advertising network or affiliate platform
- A tracking or identity solution
- A payments or revenue distribution system

These are intentional boundaries.

---

## Governance & Participation

ReferrAI is community-driven and open by design.

- Discussions happen in public GitHub issues and PRs
- Contributions are reviewed with a strong **Non-Goals** posture
- Long-term stewardship may transition to a neutral standards body

We welcome participation from:
- AI platform teams
- Retailers and retail media networks
- Publishers and content platforms
- Privacy, policy, and standards experts

---

## Core Principle

> **No identity. No tracking. Just provenance.**
